 return:
-------------

          The return statement is used to end the execution of a function and specifies the value to
          be returned by that function. When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops
          executing, and the value specified in the return statement is passed back to the caller. After a return statement is executed, no further
         code within the function is executed. Example:


break:
----------

            When a break statement is encountered within a loop, the loop is immediately terminated, and the program continues with the next statement following the loop. 


memory constrain :
--------------------
Node.js applications running on servers or other environments typically have access to 
more memory than browser-based JavaScript applications due to several factors:

what are browser-based javascript application?
-----------------------------------------------------

Browser-based JavaScript applications, also known as web applications, run within a web browser 
environment and are primarily designed to be executed on client devices such
as desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets


 in JavaScript, arrays are dynamic and resizable, and you don't need to specify
a fixed size when declaring an array. You can add elements to the array dynamically, 
and it will resize itself as needed. Therefore, there is no predefined limit on the number
of elements you can store in a JavaScript array,
0ther than the memory constraints of the environment in which the JavaScript code is running.

//  C LANGUAGE MEMORY CONSTRAIN TO VARIABLES : 
------------------------------------------------
Bits: A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer, representing a binary digit - either 0 or 1
Bytes: A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits.


one byte = 8 bits 
INTEGER  -> 4 BYTES [2power32 unique values we stores]
float -> 4  Bytes[  ,, ]
char -> 1 byte[ 2 power 8 unique values stores]
double -> 8 bytes[2 power 64 unique values]
