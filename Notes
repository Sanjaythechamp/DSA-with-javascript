 return:

          The return statement is used to end the execution of a function and specifies the value to
          be returned by that function. When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops
          executing, and the value specified in the return statement is passed back to the caller. After a return statement is executed, no further
         code within the function is executed. Example:


break:

            When a break statement is encountered within a loop, the loop is immediately terminated, and the program continues with the next statement following the loop.
